## Docking Windows in an MDI Environment


</div>

### Description

This code enables you to have an MDI Child form "dock" with the MDI form like the toolbar found in the VB5/6 IDE and in various other applications. It can dock to any of the four sides of the form. Currently only support for one toolbar is there (i.e. the toolbar in VB as opposed to the project explorer and properties on the right side). This functionality may come soon.. If you find any bugs, please let me know via email or post the solution here.. An executable is also included.

This code is a variation of the post found here:

It *REQUIRES* the MsgHook32 OCX found here:
